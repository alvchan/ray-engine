# ray-engine

An improved and expanded version of the raycaster engine written in Python from 2023, which died with my school GitHub account.

Not overly complicated in terms of C code, but is a demonstration of raycasting as a form of practice for my C-fu.

I have chosen to use raylib in this project for graphical applications to focus on 
improving my C programming skills instead of OpenGL with its higher difficulty curve.

## Installation

1. Install raylib. Check out the wiki at https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki for an in-depth guide to install and develop with it.
2. Compile 'ray.c' with `gcc ray.c -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lx11`.
3. Run it and run around in this test world.
